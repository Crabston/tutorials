# About this site
Crabston Tutorials is a site made by [Crabston GmbH](https://crabston.ch) with guides for [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org) and various other topics in the field of web and IT. The site is publicly accessible and free to use ([CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0)).

## Notes
1. The content of the site is primarily written in German, but there are also some English guides. The site is regularly updated and expanded to provide users with up-to-date and helpful information.
2. Since the site was created primarily for Crabston GmbH customers, some guides may be specific to these websites, as they contain their own configurations that your website may not have. However, you are still allowed to use and share these guides.
3. The Grav guides refer to the management of an existing website with Grav, not to the installation of Grav itself or the creation of a new website. For this, please refer to the [official Grav documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org).
4. Please read the guides carefully and test your changes on a test environment or in a private area before applying them to your live website. This can lead to unwanted results if you are not careful.
5. Although the guides are carefully created and based on the latest information, they may no longer be up to date or no longer work. We strive to review and update the guides regularly, but cannot guarantee their accuracy and functionality.
